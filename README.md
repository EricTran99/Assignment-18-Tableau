# Citi Bike Data Analysis-Tablaeu

This module focus on the Tableau program's tool for data visualisation where the Citi Bike dataset from 2013 is used for creating visualisation to showcase various trends and outliners that wouldn't be possible to notice through pure statistics.

<h1>Key note </h1>
The software, Tableau, is a free version, hence there are certain limitation into completing the task, though it shouldn't affect the 
dataset. 

In the repository are the files which can be opened with the Tableau, below are the the link to the data, as well as the images of the data (dashboard in case there's any issues)

<h2> The Dataset</h2>
The citi bike data, contains details about each of the station location and name, in addition to telling the trip duration from one station to another in New York City.
The chosen data is the '2013-06 citi-data', mainly due to the limitation of the free version. Due to the size of the csv file, the system tends to become slow in corporating the data
therefore, if anymore data were to be added, it would lead to an extremely slow process. And the free-version can only uphold a certain amount of raw data.

Here are the images in case the image doesn't upload properly.

<h2> Key findings with the visuals</h2>
There are four dashboards, each containing different values and provides a unique perspective to the results

<h3>1. full location of the station</h3>

This image shows all of the known station location found in New York city, the station are counted based on the number of time it's the starting point for the bike travel. Across the year set,
the most common station has been within the inner city compared to the other station at the bottom. This indicates that the majority of the people who ride bikes tends to be in the city due to 
the sheer ease of riding the city with the bike compared to traveling in a vehicle. This also supports with most of the high number of station (green circle) are in areas where cars have little
ways in traveling, such as by the seaside or docks

<h4>2. comparing the top 10 with the bot 10</h4>

this image highlights the top 10 station location and compare with the 10 least popular stations. By looking at the geographical location of the station, a clear distinction of the preference in 
using the city bikes. This can be due to the density of the inner city where the cars struggle to manevour around the small area. Whereas the land at the bottom tends to be more open, hence favouring
cars over bikes.

This image further supports the initial reason with values of the most common compared to the least popular across the year.

<h5>3. line & bar graph</h5>

this dashboard shows the line and bar graph found in creating the visulisations. There are certain findings that were interesting.
- the bar chart shows one particular station which have the highest value of trip duration per number count of station compared to the other stations. One possible reasoning may be that the riders from 
'Madison & Montgomery St' would have rode farther away.
- the two line graphs showcase when the usage of citi bike are most common, where the line graph (bottom left) shows two peaks in 8:00 and 17:00, indicating that city bike are most commonly used during peak hours
either used to ride to the nearest train station or for personal convenient reason. The addition of the red color further helps visualising when city bike are used. the line graph (right) shows a growth in city bike
across the year. The growth popularity of using bike in the city has been popular as the people demand for easier transportation across the city within th 1980s. However, there's been a decrease after 1990s, with the
possible assumption of people prefering to drive to the city with the car over bike.
